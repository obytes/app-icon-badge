✨ Easily generate icons with environment and version badges for your Mobile application. ✨
</p>

<hr/>

## 🚀 Motivation

During the development of a mobile application, we typically generate different applications based on the environment (staging, development, production).

However, it starts getting confusing when we install all of them on our device, especially if they have the same icon and name. In addition to that, it is difficult for our testers to trace bugs not knowing which version of the application they are using.

Therefore, we need a way to differentiate the applications based on the environment and version. This library generates a badge with the environment and version information and adds it to the app icon.

## 📱 Features

- 🙌 Easy to use as an Expo plugin or a simple library.
- 📱 Supports universal icons and adaptive icons.
- 🧩 Supports multiple badges.
- 🎨 Fully customizable; you can change the badge text, color, background, and position.

## 📦 Installation

Install the package.

```bash
## Using yarn
yarn add app-icon-badge
## Using npm
npm install app-icon-badge
## Using pnpm
pnpm add app-icon-badge
```

## 🛠️ Usage

### Expo Plugin

As we mentioned above, we built the package to be used in Expo projects and generate icons that will be provided to the `icon` and `android.adaptiveIcon.foregroundImage` properties in `app.json`. So, we recommend following the [official Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/app-icons) to generate the icons.

To use the plugin, you need to add it to your `app.config.js` file.

```javascript
// app.config.js
const environment = 'staging'; // development, staging, production

export default ({ config }) => ({
  // your config here ...
  ...config,
  name: 'my-app',
  icon: './assets/icon.png',
  android: {
    adaptiveIcon: {
      foregroundImage: './assets/adaptive-icon.png',
      backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    [
      'app-icon-badge',
      {
        enabled: true, // enable/ disable the plugin based on the environment (usually disabled for production builds)
        badges: [
          {
            text: environment, // banner text
            type: 'banner', // banner or ribbon
            color: 'white', // by default it will be white and the only color supported for now is white and black
            background: '#FF0000', // by default it will be black and we are only supporting hex format for colors
          },
          {
            text: 'V1.0.1',
            type: 'ribbon',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  ],
});
```

Options:

- `enabled` - enable/disable the plugin based on the environment (usually disabled for production builds)
- `badges` - an array of badges, you can think of it as an array of layers that will be added to the icon. Each badge has :
  - `text` - the text that will be displayed on the badge.
  - `type` - the type of the badge, either `banner` or `ribbon` (default is `banner`).
  - `position` - the position of the badge, based on the `type` property, it can be `top` or `bottom` for `banner` and `left` or `right` for `ribbon` (default is `top` for `banner` and `right` for `ribbon`).
  - `color` - the color of the text only `black` and `white` color are supported (default is `white`).
  - `background` - the background color of the badge, only hex format is supported (default is `#000000`).

> Note: please refer to [our starter](https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes/blob/master/app.config.ts) for a complete working example.

This plugin, when enabled, will use the `icon` and `android.adaptiveIcon.foregroundImage` properties in `app.json` to generate icons with badges, which will be saved in the `.expo` directory. The plugin will then update your Expo config to use these new icons instead of the original ones. If you are familiar with Expo plugins, you can take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/obytes/app-icon-badge/blob/master/app.plugin.ts).

### As a library

We also wanted to make it possible to use the library in any React Native project, so we added the ability to use it as a library, but it's up to you to make it work with the build process you are using.

```javascript
import { addBadge } from 'app-icon-badge';
import path from 'path';

const icon = path.resolve(__dirname, './assets/icon.png');

addBadge({
  icon,
  dstPath: './assets/icon.${environment}.png', // optional, if not provided the icon will be generated in the same directory as the original icon under  the name 'icon.result.png'
  badges: [
    {
      text: 'staging',
      type: 'banner',
      color: 'white', // by default it will be white and the only color supported for now is white and black
      background: '#FF0000', // by default it will be black and we are only supporting hex format for colors
    },
    {
      text: 'V1.0.1',
      type: 'ribbon',
    },
  ],
});
```

## API

- `icon` - the path to the original icon you want to add the badge to.
- `dstPath` - the path to the generated icon with the badge. If not provided, the icon will be generated in the same directory as the original icon under the name `icon.result.png`.
- `badges` - an array of badges, you can think of it as an array of layers that will be added to the icon. Each badge has :
  - `text` - the text that will be displayed on the badge.
  - `type` - the type of the badge, either `banner` or `ribbon` (default is `banner`).
  - `position` - the position of the badge, based on the `type` property, it can be `top` or `bottom` for `banner` and `left` or `right` for `ribbon` (default is `top` for `banner` and `right` for `ribbon`).
  - `color` - the color of the text only `black` and `white` color are supported (default is `white`).
  - `background` - the background color of the badge, only hex format is supported (default is `#000000`).

## You can also use it as a CLI tool by running: `npx app-icon-badge ......`

## 🚧 RoadMap

The library is still in its early stages. We have a lot of ideas to improve it and make it more useful. Here are some of the things we have already had the chance to implement, as well as our plans for additions in the future:

- [x] Generate icons with environment & version badges for ios
- [x] Expo plugin
- [x] publish the library to npm
- [x] Add support for Android Adaptive Icons
- [ ] Add Tests
- [x] Add support for custom badge colors
- [ ] Add the ability to run as a CLI tool (WIP)

Feel free to suggest any other features or contribute to the project yourself by helping us implement upcoming features.

## 👀 More about the library

The library uses [Jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp), an image-processing library for Node with zero native dependencies, to generate app icons with environment or version badges.

This Library was built to work with expo projects, but it can also be used in any React Native project and as a standalone library to generate icons with badges.

> Worth mentioning that this library was built to be added to the build process of our react native starter kit [Obytes Starter](https://starter.obytes.com/). The starter kit is based on the best practices and tools that we have found to be most effective in our own projects and it comes with this library pre-installed and configured. Make sure to give it a try if you are looking for a React Native starter kit.

## 🔥 How to contribute?
